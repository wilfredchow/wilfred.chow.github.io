            <p>Teaching and mentorship are crucial to my development and growth as a scholar. My teaching philosophy has three objectives:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Exposing students to the cutting edge of political science research</li>
                <li>Engaging with diverse student learning styles</li>
                <li>Continuously improving my instruction to meet student needs</li>
            </ol>
            <p>My hope is that in grounding my teaching with these objectives, I can inspire students to take ownership of their learning both in and beyond the classroom. Below is a sample of the courses that I have taught at the undergraduate and postgraduate level, which reflect my teaching philosophy.</p>
